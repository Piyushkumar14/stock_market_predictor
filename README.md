# Stock Price Prediction with Random Forest Regressor

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using a Random Forest Regressor model and incorporates a backtesting engine to accurately measure the model's predictive performance. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into potential stock price movements, aiding investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Random Forest Regressor:** Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to predict stock prices, capturing complex relationships within the data.

- **Backtesting Engine:** Implements a backtesting framework to evaluate the model's performance on historical data. This allows us to simulate how the model would have performed in the past, providing a more realistic assessment of its accuracy.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** Contains historical stock price data used for training and testing the model.

- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and backtesting.

- **`src/`:** Python source code for model implementation, backtesting engine, and utility functions.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download Data:**

   Obtain historical stock price data and place it in the data/ directory.

4. **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**

   Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data analysis, model training, and backtesting.
  
## Usage
1. **Train the Model:**

   Execute the train_model.ipynb notebook to train the Random Forest Regressor on historical stock price data.
2. **Backtest the Model:**

   Run the backtesting.ipynb notebook to assess the model's performance using the backtesting engine.
3. **Predict Stock Prices:**

   Use the trained model to predict future stock prices by running the predict.ipynb notebook.

## Results

Include insights gained from the model, key performance metrics, and visualizations that showcase the model's predictive capabilities. Discuss any challenges encountered during the project and potential areas for improvement.

Happy predicting!
